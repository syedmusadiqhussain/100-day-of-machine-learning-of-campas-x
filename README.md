## 💫 About This Journey

Welcome to my 100 Days of Machine Learning challenge! This repository chronicles my transformation from an ML enthusiast to a practitioner, documenting every step, stumble, and success along the way.

**🎯 Mission:** To build a strong foundation in Machine Learning through consistent daily practice, hands-on projects, and real-world applications.

> **Note:** I started this journey on December 21, 2024, but I'm uploading the content a bit late. Better late than never! Every great journey begins with a single step, and this is mine. 🌟
